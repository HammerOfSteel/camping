### Current Website
- Built with template by Websimon (websimon.se)
- Very basic, dated design (not mobile optimized obviously)
- Functional but lacks modern UX
- Archive.org images used on several pages

## Key Statistics

- **50** parking spaces with electricity
- **50** tent sites
- **15** smaller cabins
- **12** self-catered cottages
- **30+** years canoe center experience
- **30,000** wild moose in region
- **Norrland's largest** canoe center claim
- **100+ wind shelters** on main Hårkan route

## Functionality Gaps/Opportunities for Improvement

1. **No clear high-quality hero imagery** - Mostly archive images
2. **No testimonials/reviews visible** - Could showcase customer satisfaction
3. **Mobile experience is poor** - Current design not responsive
4. **Pricing is scattered** - Would benefit from visual pricing table
5. **Canoe trip planning is complex** - Could use interactive map or route finder
6. **Limited visual appeal** - Basic HTML/CSS design
7. **No modern features**:
   - No live availability calendar
   - No email signup/newsletter
   - No photo galleries with good UX
   - No interactive map
   - No social media integration
8. **Contact form missing** - Only phone/email options
9. **Limited content on the vibe/experience** - Could better capture the "little lake hill" community feeling
10. **No accessibility features** - WCAG compliance likely lacking

## Content to Preserve

When redesigning, the following must be maintained:
- All factual information about accommodations and pricing
- Complete Hårkan Trip route descriptions and safety notes
- Contact information and booking procedures
- The friendly, community-oriented tone
- 7 key differentiators (already unique in market)
- Multilingual support (at minimum English/Swedish/German)
- All cabin and facility details
- Canoe service details and route information
